# A single-&lt;div&gt; thermometer

Early in my web development training, I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7VUhEdM2aY&t=1320s) about a developer who was fascinated with making web graphics and animations using only a single &lt;div&gt;.

My imagination was captured (and the homework hadn't gotten too challenging yet), so I thought I'd try my hand at it.

Take a look!
